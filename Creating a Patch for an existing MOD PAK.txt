How to Create a Patch for an existing MOD PAK ?

Background:
	Mods in NMS are loaded from top to bottom (when listed in alphabetical order).
	Lower mods that modify the same file in any above mod will win all changes to that file

So, to make a Patch for a mod named xyz.pak, you could do:
	1. Extract from that mod PAK the file you want to change, it gives you a .MBIN
	2. Decompile the .MBIN to .EXML format using the appropriate MBINCompiler version
	3. Find what you want to change and make these changes by hand to the .EXML file
	4. Recompile the .EXML file to .MBIN using the "latest" MBINCompiler version
	5. Pack this new .MBIN file to a new .PAK (name it as you like) as "ZZZPatch_xyz.pak"
	6. Make sure the name is lower than the original PAK file in ascending alphabetical order
		so it load later
	7. Place both files into your NMS MODS folder
	8. Verify that the DISABLEMODS.TXT file in PCBANKS folder is still deleted
	9. Enjoy

	Using the .EXML file from the mod xyz.pak ensure that most, if not all, of the changes made by the MOD
	will be saved and the MOD will continue to work as intended.
	In using the ZZZPatch_xyz.pak, only if you changed something that affects that MOD, will that change how the MOD works
	otherwise the MOD AND YOUR CHANGES will work as planned by you.

MODBUILDER can help in creating the "ZZZPatch_xyz.pak"
	A. Create a simple "ZZZMyScript.lua" script with the changes you want to make to the .EXML file (covers steps 1., 2. and 3. above)
		***** We have included plenty of examples and a Script_Rules.txt file to help in creating a script *****
		Note: "ZZZ" in the name tryies to make it load ~last in MODS. Change the name to suit our paks
	B. Copy the script AND the MOD PAK you want to patch to the ModScript folder (and steps 4. thru 8. are handled by MODBUILDER)
		Note: Having more than one pak in ModScript will NOT combine both paks, only the last one will combine
		      if it mofidies the same .EXML file
		Note: A future version will probably be able to handle correctly multiple paks in ModScript
	C. MODBUILDER will attempt to use your MBIN_FILE_SOURCE named in the script by searching for it in the mod PAK
	  *** If found, that will preserve the mod PAK changes UNLESS you have changed the exact same values with your script ***
	  *** which could be what you want to do... ***
	D. A new mod PAK will be created in the CreatedModPAKs folder (give it the name you want in the script)
		or after by renaming it
	E. Use that new PAK in 7. above if you did not let MODBUILDER copy it for you
	F. Verify that the DISABLEMODS.TXT file in PCBANKS folder is still deleted if you did not let MODBUILDER delete it for you
	G. Enjoy
	
NOTES: * The name of the lua script "ZZZMyScript.lua" can be changed.
       * Any other script can be put in ModScript at the same time, they will all be COMBINED in the resulting PAK
       * The name of the resulting pak "ZZZPatch_xyz.pak" can be changed, but should be at the BOTTOM of the NMS MODS folder
